# 🔬 EUDI Secure Systems Laboratory
## Complementary Fork of the EU Digital Identity Wallet Reference Implementation

> ⚠ **Disclaimer**
> This repository is an independent public laboratory fork of the official EU Digital Identity Wallet reference implementation .
>
> It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by the European Commission or the official EUDI consortium**.
>
> The purpose of this fork is to explore a **minimal, security-focused, systems-level implementation** aligned with the Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), with an emphasis on:
>
> * Reduced trusted computing base (TCB)
> * C/C++ native implementations
> * GNU/Linux integration
> * Auditable cryptographic correctness
> * Transparent, condensed and publicly reviewable development
>
> This laboratory aims to remain strictly specification-aligned and interoperable with the official reference implementation.
>
> Future upstream collaboration or consolidation remains explicitly welcome.

The EU Digital Identity Wallet will be:

* **made available to anyone who wants to use it**:  Any EU citizen, resident, and business in the EU who would like to make use of the EU Digital Identity will be able to do so.
* **used widely**: EU Digital Identity Wallets will be used as a way to identify users when providing them with access to public and private digital services across the EU.
* **controlled by users**: The EU Digital Identity Wallets will enable people to choose and keep track of their identity, data and certificates which they share with third parties. Anything which is not necessary to share will not be shared.

Consumers should also be able to access services online without having to use private platforms or unnecessarily sharing personal data. They will have full control of the data they share.

## Architecture and Reference Framework

On 3 June 2021, the European Commission adopted a Recommendation calling on Member States to work towards the development of a [a common toolbox](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-toolbox) including a technical [Architecture and Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md) a set of common standards and technical specifications and a set of common guidelines and best practices.

The new Regulation specifies that these outcomes will serve as a basis for the implementation of the proposal for a European Digital Identity Framework, without the process of developing the Toolbox interfering with, or prejudging the legislative process.

The new Regulation foresees that the Toolbox is developed by Member States’ experts in the eIDAS Expert Group  in close coordination with the Commission and, where relevant for the functioning of the European
Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet infrastructure, other concerned public and private sector parties.

The current **authoritative version** is tagged as [release/tag in this repository](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework/releases).

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation below is built based on the [Architecture Reference Framework](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md).

## ⭐Wallet Reference Implementation - Open Source Code

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation aims at showcasing a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

🚀 EUDI Wallet open source code is available online!
